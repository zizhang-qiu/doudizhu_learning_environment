doudizhu_learning_environment is a research platform for a game named
doudizhu (aka fighting the landlord) [(wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu).

The library is written in C++. You can use Cmake to compile and run examples.

The moves in this library are encoded identically with [RLCard](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard/tree/master).

The main usage of the library is very similar with [hanabi_learning_environment](https://github.com/google-deepmind/hanabi-learning-environment/tree/master)
and [bridge_learning_environment](https://github.com/zizhang-qiu/bridge_learning/tree/main/bridge_lib).

Todo:
- [ ] Doudizhu observation encoders.
- [ ] Gym-like rl envs.
- [ ] Doudizhu game examples.
